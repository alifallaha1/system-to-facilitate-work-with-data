# system-to-facilitate-work-with-data
This system makes it easier for the data analyst who is not proficient in the programming language to carry out the basic steps in the data processing process through a graphical interface and also to build a model through Machine Learning and evaluate it, and then output the file containing the required data
The system consists of several interfaces, an interface to enter files, and choose the file on which the model will be trained. It displays first the column names and types, after that it can change the values of the text columns, where the values ​​of the selected column are displayed, and then the value to be replaced is determined, then the empty values processing section comes Either by deleting the column or line, or filling in the empty elements, and then we move to the next interface so that we can explore the data by selecting the desired column, and a graph of this column appears with the ability to save the graph The next interface explores the interconnected columns, so the chosen column is selected first, and then the columns that are associated with the selected column by 70% or more are shown, either negatively or positively. In the last interface, unwanted columns are first deleted, and then the target column is selected, and if it is not specified, it is selected. The last column also selects the percentage of training and testing for the input file, after which the desired method is chosen, and then a file is output with the inclusion of the prediction column for the second input file with the file being trained.
